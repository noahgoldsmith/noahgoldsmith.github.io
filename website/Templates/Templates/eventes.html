    <p>Introduction
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Blessup Live 2022, was my first successful event. I started a clothing brand in 2017 that began a segway into production for me. This brand has allowed me to create music videos, commercials, music, and host events such as a sports camp and a new event called Blessup Live is like a mix of Chappell show, Jimmy Fallon and Saturday Night Live without the dirt. I put this event on in order to invest in trash pickup of underdeveloped communities but ended up using the proceeds to sponsor a year of tuition for students in Haiti.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Special Event</p>
    <p>&nbsp;This event was special to me because it was the night before a year of sobriety for me. I also was a 2020 graduate that didn’t have a senior prom and April 30th, 2022, ended up being the same day my high school had their prom at the same venue Blessup Live was. I sold tickets on my website and had doubts the event would be successful but it turned out very well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blessup Live&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The event consisted of a vendor fair, live performances, and a fashion show where participants sported the Blessup Brand. The Vendor fair allowed my brand to sell merchandise. It also hosted a bakery, a recording artist, a natural soap company, and a custom t-shirt business. While all the shopping was going on, there was live music and refreshments for everyone to enjoy. Following the vendor fair, we kicked off the start of the show with live performances with Tamika Foggie, Recording Artist out of St. Louis Blessing the house with her angelic voice, following her we had a choir travel from Nebraska, and premiered a new music video we shot at a local church. To end the performances, we had 2 gospel rappers close the show. Of course, this being the first- time event happened, I made sure to capture plenty of audio and video recorded for the sake of promoting the next event. Most of the revenue came from merchandise sales, as regular admission was only $10. Some people chose to sponsor the event with the ability to purchase different tickets that cost more.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After The Show</p>
    <p>&nbsp;It was a warm summer night. As we packed up the show, the saxophone player was still jamming in the circle drive and my ex is walking through the doors with her prom date. I gave her a big hug after not seeing her for 2 years, shared a few words, dapped up her prom date and went back home. As I digressed, I looked at the media acquired from the event and saw overwhelming smiles from everybody who attended the event. It was as if they forgot about all the struggles that everyday life brings.</p>
